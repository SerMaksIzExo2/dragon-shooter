## **Setup**

Since this project has been a tutorial I will not write a new "Setup", but you can follow the following tutorials to do the same project

You can read the followed [official tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1), but is in JS
or watch the followed video[tutorial in TS by @supertommy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXxmSbfR2aY&t)

If you still want to use my project

1. Clone/Download the repository.

```console
git clone https://github.com/udsgit/chest-collector.git
```

2. You may have to install the packages with **NPM**.

```console
npm install
```

3. Enjoy, any questions, follow the previous tutorials.

## **Usage**

1. Open the link from the [Demo](https://udsgit.github.io/chest-collector) or open the file **index.html** if you downloaded it.
2. Now you can interact with the "Game".
3. To move, you will use the arrows on the keyboard and you can take the chests that will appear. The game only consists of that, since it is a first contact.

## **Status**

Project is: **_Completed._**

Since it has served to know the first contact, but it will continue to be improved through new commits or new repositories making other games.
